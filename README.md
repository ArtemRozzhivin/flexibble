# Flexibble

![Flexibble](/public/mainscreen.png 'Main screen')

Flexibble is a full-stack project inspired by the famous Dribbble website, a self-promotion and social networking platform for digital designers. It serves as a platform for designers' portfolios, a job search site, and a recruiting platform. Flexibble aims to create a similar platform for designers, software developers, game developers, and other creatives to showcase their work.

## Technologies used

- TypeScript
- React
- Tailwind CSS
- Next.js
- GraphQL
- Grafbase

## Features.

- **Authentication**: Users can log in with their Google accounts.

- Frontend and Backend: Flexibble is a full-stack application. The frontend is built using React and Next.js, while the backend uses Grafbase as a database.

- CRUD operations: The frontend allows users to perform create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations, allowing them to manage their projects efficiently.

- Pagination: The application includes pagination to help manage a large number of projects more efficiently.

- Search by category\*\*: Users can search for projects by category, making it easier to find the content they need.

- User accounts: Users can create and manage their own accounts on Flexibble.

## Learning experience.

While developing this application, I gained valuable experience in the following areas:

- **Next.js**: I learned how to use Next.js for application routing and server-side rendering.

- Filtering functionality: Implementing filtering functionality to help users find projects more efficiently.

- Pagination\*\*: Developed full pagination capabilities to manage large data sets.

- Image uploading: Handling image uploads, which is an important feature for a platform like Flexibble.

- TypeScript: Gain skills in writing TypeScript code for better type safety.

- Grafbase: I learned how to work with Grafbase, a serverless GraphQL platform, and how to connect it to a Flexibble application.
